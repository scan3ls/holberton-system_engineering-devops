# 0x0F. Load balancer

This is a repository containing assignments for Holberton School.

|FILES| DESCRIPTIONS|
|---|---|
|0-custom_http_response_header|  In this first task you need to configure ```web-02``` to be identical to ```web-01```. Fortunately, you built a Bash script during your web server project, and they’ll now come in handy to easily configure ```web-02```. Remember, always try to automate your work!|
|1-install_load_balancer|  Install and configure HAproxy on your ```lb-01``` server.|
|2-puppet_custom_http_response_header.pp|  Just as in task #0, we’d like you to automate the task of creating a custom HTTP header response, but with Puppet.|
